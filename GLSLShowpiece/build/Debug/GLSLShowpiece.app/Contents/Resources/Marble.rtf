\f0\fs24 \cf0 This shader illustrates the power of the 
\f1\b noise
\f0\b0  function.  The Apple Software Renderer implements a high quality perlin noise function that modulates 8 octaves of noise in up to 3 dimensions.  By taking the absolute value of the noise function, one can produce veins much like that found in marble.  Modulated with the per vertex lighting calculated in the vertex shader, this lit marble sphere can be produced.\

However it is useful to use a noise texture, as hardware does not support the noise instructions.}
